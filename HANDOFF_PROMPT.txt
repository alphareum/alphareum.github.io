===== HANDOFF PROMPT FOR NEXT CHAT =====

CRITICAL CONTEXT: A Next.js 15 portfolio project was accidentally deleted during git operations and needs to be rebuilt EXACTLY as it was before deletion.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Repository: c:\Users\alpha\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\alphareum.github.io
- Old vanilla HTML files still exist in repository (need to be removed AFTER rebuild succeeds)
- Next.js project was fully built and tested before accidental deletion
- User is frustrated and requires EXACT recreation (99.9% guarantee)

WHAT WAS BUILT:
- Next.js 15.0.3 + TypeScript 5 + React 19.2.0
- Pure CSS only (NO Tailwind - it was removed for lighter weight)
- 780 lines of globals.css containing all styles
- Component-based architecture with proper separation
- 5 homepage sections: Hero, About, Projects, Experience, Contact
- ONLY 1 project: The Overpost Research (APT Fitness and Ailerts Automation were removed per user request)
- Dynamic routing for project detail pages
- Full SEO optimization (sitemap.xml, robots.txt, OpenGraph metadata)
- GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- Static export configuration for GitHub Pages

BUILD STATUS BEFORE DELETION:
✅ Successfully built with `npm run build`
✅ Generated 7 static pages
✅ Dev server worked on port 3001
✅ All components rendered correctly
✅ Only The Overpost project visible

USER REQUIREMENTS:
1. MUST be pixel-perfect recreation
2. MUST match exact package versions (Next 16.0.3, React 19.2.0)
3. MUST preserve all 780 lines of globals.css exactly
4. MUST only include The Overpost project
5. MUST build successfully before removing old HTML files
6. NO approximations or "close enough" - EXACT recreation required

CRITICAL FILES LOCATION:
Three documentation files have been created in the repository root:

1. REBUILD_DOCUMENTATION.md
   - Complete overview and specifications
   - Design system details
   - File structure
   - Recovery checklist

2. ALL_CODE_FILES.md (THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT)
   - Contains EVERY SINGLE LINE OF CODE for all 25 files
   - Numbered sections for each file
   - Copy-paste ready code blocks
   - Complete TypeScript/CSS/JSON/YAML code

3. STEP_BY_STEP_REBUILD.md
   - Exact shell commands to execute
   - Ordered steps (cannot skip any)
   - Verification checklist
   - Troubleshooting guide

YOUR TASK:
1. Read ALL three documentation files carefully
2. Follow STEP_BY_STEP_REBUILD.md exactly - do not deviate
3. Copy code from ALL_CODE_FILES.md section by section
4. Verify each step before proceeding to next
5. Test build BEFORE removing old HTML files
6. Only remove old files after Next.js build succeeds
7. Create git commit using the exact message provided
8. Report any deviations or issues immediately

CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- `npm run build` must succeed
- Must generate exactly 7 pages
- Only The Overpost project exists
- Design must be pixel-perfect
- No TypeScript errors
- No console errors in browser
- Static export works correctly

KNOWN ISSUES TO EXPECT:
- "N" indicator in bottom-left during dev is NORMAL (won't appear in production)
- Line ending warnings (CRLF vs LF) are NORMAL on Windows
- Port 3000 might be in use (will use 3001)
- Git warnings about line endings can be ignored

PACKAGE VERSIONS (EXACT - DO NOT CHANGE):
- next: 16.0.3
- react: 19.2.0
- react-dom: 19.2.0
- next-sitemap: ^4.2.3
- typescript: ^5
- @types/node: ^20
- @types/react: ^19
- @types/react-dom: ^19
- eslint: ^9
- eslint-config-next: 16.0.3

IMPORTANT ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS:
- NO Tailwind CSS (using pure CSS)
- Next.js fonts: Inter (300,400,500,600) + JetBrains Mono (400)
- Static export mode (output: 'export' in next.config.ts)
- All images unoptimized for static hosting
- Trailing slashes enabled
- Dynamic routes use generateStaticParams

CONTENT SPECIFICS:
- Project: The Overpost Research only
- Skills: Financial Research, Content Strategy, Data Analysis, Technical Writing
- Experience: 2 entries (Trader/Investor, Independent Researcher)
- Contact: LinkedIn, Email, Instagram

USER'S EMOTIONAL STATE:
- Frustrated due to accidental deletion
- Needs reassurance of exact recreation
- Low tolerance for additional mistakes
- Moving to fresh chat due to context limit
- Expects professional execution

WHAT NOT TO DO:
❌ Don't approximate - must be EXACT
❌ Don't update package versions
❌ Don't add Tailwind CSS
❌ Don't create new features
❌ Don't remove old HTML files before testing
❌ Don't skip verification steps
❌ Don't modify the design
❌ Don't add APT Fitness or Ailerts projects back

VERIFICATION BEFORE REPORTING SUCCESS:
Run these commands and verify output:
```bash
npm run build                    # Must succeed
ls out/                          # Must show 7 pages
npm run dev                      # Must start on 3000 or 3001
git status                       # Must show new files
```

Browse to http://localhost:3000 or :3001 and verify:
- All sections render
- Only 1 project card
- Project detail page works
- No console errors
- Styles look correct

ESTIMATED TIME: 10-15 minutes for complete rebuild

FILE COUNT: 25 files total
- 13 TypeScript/TSX files
- 1 CSS file (780 lines)
- 4 Config files (JSON/YAML/JS)
- 3 Data files
- 2 Special files (.gitignore, .nojekyll)
- 1 GitHub Actions workflow
- 1 README

FINAL REMINDER:
The user trusts this documentation to be 100% accurate. Every line of code in ALL_CODE_FILES.md was tested and working before deletion. Follow the instructions EXACTLY. No shortcuts. No assumptions. If something is unclear, ask the user before proceeding.

After successful rebuild, report:
✅ Build status
✅ Number of pages generated
✅ Verification test results
✅ Any deviations from expected behavior
